# MysticExpanded-1.19.2

This is meant to be a mod that adds magical content to the game, based off
of early Enocian belief, with asthetic influence from Arabic myth. 
I am a novice mod author at best, ignorant in almost all methods and jargon, 
though learning quickly. Below will be a document I wrote out that outlines
some of what I would like to achieve with this mod. 



Focused around magic and the abilities that lie therein.

To achieve this, there will be several items added to the game to start the player on their journey.

Completed Steps will be signified by a " + "

Ores to be added

-Beryl +
-Amethyst +
-Carbuncle +
-Carnelion +
-Chalcedony +
-Chrysolite +
-Jacinth +
-Ligurus +
-Onyx +
-Sapphire +
-Pearl (kinda)
-Topaz +

+------------+

Magic System Base

Magic will be based on the collection of Soul Residue, or SR.
The player will have a set amount of SR that increases over time. 
SR will also be able to be found in the world, or refined, to power
magical constructs and machines. Common combat and utility magic will be 
based on simple primal runes, either held in the hand, or projected
through a spell focus. The second and more advanced tier of magic will allow some
customizability to the player, allowing them to combine these runes
like simple heiroglyphs, within consumable scrolls, or determined tablets.
See "Angelic Symbology of John Dee" for rune concepts.

+------------+

Portals

This mod will have a moderate focus on portals, and dimensions.
there will be varius portals, and their forms, will allow for different tasks.

First Degree of portals will be rather simple, allowing the infinite extraction of
simple elemental objects. Lava, Water, Earth (Soul Residue), Air (Forced mob movement).

Second Degree of portals will allow movement within the dimensions of the game freely.
Portals will be linked with a "Divine Crystal" which will allow the marking of the 
start and end location. Multiple portals can lead to the same place, if one portal leads
to multiple places, a random output will be chosen.

Third Degree of portals will teleport the player to custom dimensions. There will be 4
dimensions, where new items, and enemies can be fought. These dimensions will be focused within 
randomly generated dungeons the player is not intended to escape from (but there will be 
rewards for the creative).

+------------+

Dimensions

-Halls of the Throne (Sea of glass, Crystal of purest quality, lightning, rivers of flame. See Enoch Chap 14 Verse 9)
-Sheol ( Void, empty black halls of souls, residing within an endless cave.)
-The Mountains (Subject to change: 7 mountains named within the book of Enoch, as set in place, without earth, each of one material)
-Tartarus (Location of the final punishment of the Watchers{bosses}).

+------------+

Bosses

The Word

Allow the player to create worlds, using the "Word". A book, same as a crafted spell, but started with the word.
doing so will make all subsequent spell component symbols definitions for the world being made. In the same order of 
Genesis. The player will first define if the world has passive light, or total darkness. If light, how bright. Second,
the substance of the ground, second layer of the world, third layer, and substance of the "water". Third, skybox of the 
world, from some presets. Fourth mobs, which will be a tad limited in options early on. Fifth, if players can use magic
in their world (Note, mobs that have magic abilities will keep them, remember this for possesion mechanic).

+------------+

Spell Creation

The player will be able to write spells on paper, and consume them as scrolls, or using a scroll, engrave a spell on stone.
These spells will have a rule to their creation, following a system. The system being (Touch or Ranged, Utility or Attack,
Element or Elements of Spell, Modifiers of Spell). All effects will be applied with that order in mind. As such, a spell
that does not follow that order will be useless, and not function, resulting in an item called "Failed Spell Scroll"
Scrolls will stack up to 16, only if they have the same spell on them. Make a book shelf block that works like a
chest for spell scrolls.

+------------+


Planes

Add some form of rendering system, so that enemies are only visible on certain "planes"
add some semblance of a ranking system for demons, think of Bartameus books.

+------------+

Possesion Mechanic

Player must create magic circles, in the same manner as summoning circles. The player must stand within a circle, the
summoned entity (or in this case soon to be possessed entity), must stand within a respective circle. Once possesion
is achieved, teleport the player within the possessed entity circle, override the player model with the entity model,
create an entity with the selected players model, equip all items the player held, remove said items from players 
inventory. Now the player should be within the summoned creatures circle, with an overridden model, no items. There
should be a player entity, that doesnt move at all, that has the players current items, standing in the player circle.
The player should now be able to move freely in the chosen form. If the possessed entity dies, return player to the
player circle, cull the doppleganger sitting there, return all items to the player, reequip all items. If the doppleganger
dies, apply a screen effect, with a message "The spiritual umbilicus is severed, resurrect your body to regain power".
The player will be stuck in the entity, unable to use an item to return itself. (create a ressurection ritual that
will allow the player to ressurect their "body" I.E the doppleganger. also can be used to turn zombie villagers
to normal ones again).

+------------+

Mob Ideas

Demon that can be bound into a flute, when used, the flute will create the body of a blue giant below it, 
which the player can ride.
 Basic physical attack, no abilities otherwise. Early summon item.

Clay Golems that do different things based off of a gem used during crafting.

+------------+

Magic Ideas

2 way split in forms of magic. Internal magic, that born from the players essence, and Bound magic,
 that born from the power of summoned entities bound into an object.

+------------+

Item Ideas 

entity moving objects called "arks", that display the stored entity model above them when placed.

Ability to bind magic entities into a special type of sword, gaining the main magic effect of the entity on right click.

+------------+
